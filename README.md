How to use Meniscus

Glossary of Meniscus Wine Terms
----------
##### Tasting-specific ID
A temporary name used to identify wines during blind tastings.
##### Wine Clarity
Wines in good condition should be clear, or hazy if they are unfiltered.
##### Meniscus
The meniscus is the rim of the wine and is best examined by tilting the glass. Older wines tend to have rims that gently fade through a range of colors.
##### Color Intensity and Shade
Together, intensity and shade describe the wine's color.
- White wines range from light lemon-green to deep amber
- Ros√© wines range from pale pink to deep orange
- Red wines range from light purple to deep tawny

##### Petillance
Petillance describes the tiny bubbles that sometimes form in still wine.
##### Viscosity
A wines's viscosity can be determined by swirling the wine around in the glass and observing the tears or sheeting of the liquid that is left on the sides of the glass.
##### Sediment
Many wines will have a layer of sediment that is visible at the bottom of the bottle.
##### Condition
The condition of the wine is determined by sniffing at the top of the glass. Off-odors generally indicate a problem with a wine; it should be clean.
##### Aroma Intensity
This is the strength of the wine's aromas. Does the wine jump out at you from halfway across the room? Or can you barely smell anything at all even with your nose stuck in the glass?
##### Aromas
What does the wine smell like? Choose from a wide variety of typical wine aromas.
##### State of Development
The nose provides clues as to the relative age of the wine. Younger wines tend to have simpler, more vigorous, noses, while older wines may take a bit of time to open up and have more complex aromas.
##### Sweetness
The sweetness of the wine. Wines with high acidity may come off as drier than they actually are.
##### Acidity
The acidity of a wine can be judged by paying attention to the saliva that shoots into one's mouth after having a swallow of wine. The more saliva, the higher the acidity.
##### Tannin
Tannin produces the drying sensation typically experienced after having a cup of black tea. Tannin is a typical characteristic of red wine.
##### Alcohol Level
Yes, wine is alcoholic.
##### Body
Body describes the mouthfeel of a wine. Wines that are light and watery would be very light-bodied. Wines that are high in alcohol, acid, and tannin are full-bodied.
##### Intensity of Flavor
This describes the strength of the wine's flavor.
##### Flavors
What does the wine taste like? Choose from a wide variety of typical wine tastes.
##### Balance
Balance is the degree to which different characteristics of a wine exist in harmony. Winemakers strive to make well-balanced wines.
##### Mousse
Mousse describes the effervescence of sparkling wine and can be an indicator of production methods.
##### Length of Finish
Finish describes the length of time that the flavor lingers in the mouth after a sip of wine. Extremely long finishes - over 15 seconds - can be an indicator of quality.
##### Quality
This is an overall judgement of the wine's quality.
##### Readiness for Drinking
Different styles of wine and vintages will have different aging requirements and potential. Having evaluated the characteristics of this wine, does it appear to be too young to drink? Too old? Or just right?
##### 100-Point Score
Many reviewers report on quality using a 100-point score - that really only registers values between 70 and 100. The Meniscus slider shares this bias.
##### 5-Point Score
Other reviewers report on quality using a 5-point scoring system.
##### Other Scores
This is a field that can be used to contain scores for the wine from magazines - or any other information, for that matter.
##### Wine Name
The name of the wine as it appears on the label. (Meniscus uses this field to populate the name of the tasting note)
##### Vintage
The year the wine was produced, as it appears on the label. (Meniscus uses this field to populate the name of the tasting note)
##### Appellation
The Appellation of the wine, if relevant. (Meniscus may use this field in populating the name of the tasting note)
##### Price
Either the retail price of the wine or the price paid.
