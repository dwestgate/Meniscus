{"name":"Meniscus","tagline":"iPhone app for creating detailed wine tasting notes","body":"How to use Meniscus\r\n===================\r\n\r\n#### Overview\r\nMeniscus helps you taste wines in a systematic fashion, then turns your observations into detailed tasting notes which can be saved or shared with others.\r\n\r\nFor more information on systematic tasting, visit the website of the Wine & Spirit Educational Trust (WSET).\r\n\r\n#### Example of a Meniscus Tasting Note\r\nThis is what a Meniscus tasting note looks like.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the App\r\n-------------\r\n1. Press the **+** button to start a new tasting note\r\n2. Use the **Tasting-specific ID** field to add a temporary name for the wine (this is helpful for keeping track of wines in a blind tasting)\r\n3. Evaluate the characteristics of the wine in the order they are presented\r\n4. When you get to the end of the list of characteristics you will see your assembled tasting note\r\n5. Click on the camera button in the bottom bar and add a picture of the wine's label\r\n6. Use the action button on the bottom bar to export your note\r\n\r\nGlossary of Meniscus Wine Terms\r\n----------\r\n##### Tasting-specific ID\r\nA temporary name used to identify wines during blind tastings.\r\n##### Wine Clarity\r\nWines in good condition should be clear, or hazy if they are unfiltered.\r\n##### Meniscus\r\nThe meniscus is the rim of the wine and is best examined by tilting the glass. Older wines tend to have rims that gently fade through a range of colors.\r\n##### Color Intensity and Shade\r\nTogether, intensity and shade describe the wine's color.\r\n- White wines range from light lemon-green to deep amber\r\n- Ros√© wines range from pale pink to deep orange\r\n- Red wines range from light purple to deep tawny\r\n\r\n##### Petillance\r\nPetillance describes the tiny bubbles that sometimes form in still wine.\r\n##### Viscosity\r\nA wines's viscosity can be determined by swirling the wine around in the glass and observing the tears or sheeting of the liquid that is left on the sides of the glass.\r\n##### Sediment\r\nMany wines will have a layer of sediment that is visible at the bottom of the bottle.\r\n##### Condition\r\nThe condition of the wine is determined by sniffing at the top of the glass. Off-odors generally indicate a problem with a wine; it should be clean.\r\n##### Aroma Intensity\r\nThis is the strength of the wine's aromas. Does the wine jump out at you from halfway across the room? Or can you barely smell anything at all even with your nose stuck in the glass?\r\n##### Aromas\r\nWhat does the wine smell like? Choose from a wide variety of typical wine aromas.\r\n##### State of Development\r\nThe nose provides clues as to the relative age of the wine. Younger wines tend to have simpler, more vigorous, noses, while older wines may take a bit of time to open up and have more complex aromas.\r\n##### Sweetness\r\nThe sweetness of the wine. Wines with high acidity may come off as drier than they actually are.\r\n##### Acidity\r\nThe acidity of a wine can be judged by paying attention to the saliva that shoots into one's mouth after having a swallow of wine. The more saliva, the higher the acidity.\r\n##### Tannin\r\nTannin produces the drying sensation typically experienced after having a cup of black tea. Tannin is a typical characteristic of red wine.\r\n##### Alcohol Level\r\nYes, wine is alcoholic.\r\n##### Body\r\nBody describes the mouthfeel of a wine. Wines that are light and watery would be very light-bodied. Wines that are high in alcohol, acid, and tannin are full-bodied.\r\n##### Intensity of Flavor\r\nThis describes the strength of the wine's flavor.\r\n##### Flavors\r\nWhat does the wine taste like? Choose from a wide variety of typical wine tastes.\r\n##### Balance\r\nBalance is the degree to which different characteristics of a wine exist in harmony. Winemakers strive to make well-balanced wines.\r\n##### Mousse\r\nMousse describes the effervescence of sparkling wine and can be an indicator of production methods.\r\n##### Length of Finish\r\nFinish describes the length of time that the flavor lingers in the mouth after a sip of wine. Extremely long finishes - over 15 seconds - can be an indicator of quality.\r\n##### Quality\r\nThis is an overall judgement of the wine's quality.\r\n##### Readiness for Drinking\r\nDifferent styles of wine and vintages will have different aging requirements and potential. Having evaluated the characteristics of this wine, does it appear to be too young to drink? Too old? Or just right?\r\n##### 100-Point Score\r\nMany reviewers report on quality using a 100-point score - that really only registers values between 70 and 100. The Meniscus slider shares this bias.\r\n##### 5-Point Score\r\nOther reviewers report on quality using a 5-point scoring system.\r\n##### Other Scores\r\nThis is a field that can be used to contain scores for the wine from magazines - or any other information, for that matter.\r\n##### Wine Name\r\nThe name of the wine as it appears on the label. (Meniscus uses this field to populate the name of the tasting note)\r\n##### Vintage\r\nThe year the wine was produced, as it appears on the label. (Meniscus uses this field to populate the name of the tasting note)\r\n##### Appellation\r\nThe Appellation of the wine, if relevant. (Meniscus may use this field in populating the name of the tasting note)\r\n##### Price\r\nEither the retail price of the wine or the price paid.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nDistributed under the [MIT License](/LICENSE.md/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
