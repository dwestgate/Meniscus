Meniscus is a wine tasting application for geeks and wannabe geeks - wine geeks, that is.

The application runs through a detailed checklist of 24 wine characteristics to help you taste wines in a systematic fashion, then turns your observations into detailed tasting notes which can be saved or shared with others.

The application is particularly useful when tasting wines blind or when studying a systematic approach to wine tasting such as that taught by the WSET.

The following is a sample wine note created by the application:

2013 Catena High Mountain Vines Malbec tasted on October 26, 2015 at 10:44 PM

The wine has a medium rim and is deep purple in color. The wine forms stained legs on the glass. There is no sediment visible in the bottle.

The nose is clean. It has intense dark fruit aromas of blueberry and blackberry; spicy aromas of vanilla; and floral notes of violet and lavender. The wine comes across as fully developed.

The wine is bone dry, with medium-plus acidity. It is softly tannic and has an alcohol content of between 12.4 and 13.5 percent. It is nearly full-bodied, with strong dark fruit flavors of blueberry and blackberry; toasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate; spicy flavors of vanilla and clove; savory notes of tobacco; and animal notes of leather. It is well-balanced. It has a long finish.

This is a very good wine that has potential for aging. On a scale of one to one hundred I give this wine 91 points. Price: 17.95 at LCBO.
